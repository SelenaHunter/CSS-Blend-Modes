# CSS Blend Modes

## Getting Started

Visit the [hosted version](https://selenahunter.github.io/CSS-Blend-Modes/) and upload an image or two.  

The top set of buttons (full, half, corner) control the clip path.  

The color selector and buttons below will change the background blend mode of the selected image.


## Purpose

While working on a CSS-heavy project that involved layering multiple images and using multiple blend modes I got really tired of trying to guess what the effect I chose was really going to look like. I didn't find any other projects that did quite what I was looking for, so I built one myself. I hope it's useful to someone!
